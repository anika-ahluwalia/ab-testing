      <h2> The Motivation </h2>
      <div class="body-text"> <p> How do simple changes affect the way that a user interacts with a webpage?  </p>
        <p> For my UI UX class, I altered a cacti shopping website to examine and understand the concept of A/B testing.
          I began by making small changes to the website so that I had two versions. These changes included moving the checkout cart position, 
        adjusting the position of the "add to cart" button for each item, and changing the position of the number 
      indicating how many catci of a specific item were added to the cart. </p>
      <p>I wanted to measure how these small changes would affect the ways in whish users would interact with this website.
        I deployed two versions of the website and had users visit my website. I asked them to complete the simple task of 
        adding $150 worth of cacti into their cart and checking out. When a user loaded the website,
         a random version was chosen and displayed (either version A or B). I asked fellow students in this class to complete this task 
        and was able to get over 20 users to use the site. </p>
        <p>I then extracted the user logs of my website which allowed me to measure the time to completion of the task for each user 
         and their return rate. These were the two chosen metrics for measuring the efficiency of 
         one design over another. Finally, I sorted and cleaned this data, grouping it by website versions. I was able to 
         draw conclusions from this data using statistical analysis.

      <h2> The Expectations </h2>

        <div class="test1 col-lg-6 col-xs-12">
          <h3 class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 12px;">Time to Completion</h3>
      <div class="body-text"> <p><b>Null hypothesis:</b> There is no significant difference in time to completion of the task (putting $150 worth of cacti into a cart and checking out) between website version A and version B.</p>
<p><b>Alternative hypothesis:</b> Version B  of the website will have a faster time to completion than version A because the placement of the buttons to add items to the cart and to access the cart are more consistent with the userâ€™s anticipated workflow and natural expectations. </div></p>
        </div>
        <div class="test col-lg-6 col-xs-12">
          <h3 class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 12px;">Return Rate</h3>
          <div class="body-text"> 
            <p><b>Null hypothesis:</b> There is no significant difference in the return rate from the checkout page to the main shopping page between website version A and version B.</p>
            <p><b>Alternative hypothesis:</b> Website version B will have a higher return rate than version A because  the placement of the cart in website A is in a place that forces the user to actively look at it more than in version B, which will result in them thinking more about their total before checking out.</p>

      <h2> The Results </h2>
      <div class="body-text" style="padding-bottom: 20px;">I created an inforgraphic to illustrate what I learned from the data that I gathered and what the results of the analysis demonstrated.</div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2> The Takeaways </h2>
      <div class="body-text"> <p> Ultimately, I found this project to be really useful in understanding the importance of statistical analysis in design and learning how to interpret data. 
        The results for both of the metrics that I measured (time to completion and return rate) ended up not being statistically significant. 
        I think that a shortcoming of this project was the limited sample size that I dealt with. This small sample size resulted in the variations that I 
        saw being easily distorted by outliers and make it more difficult for my data to be interpretted as significant. Even though I did find that the average time for 
        task completion was higher in version A of the website, this result was not significant due to the smaller sample size.
        I also think that the testing instructions could have been clearer so that the data was more accurate and consistent across users. 
        Overall, it was a really valuable experience in understanding testing and statistical analysis.
